# Eyes Exercise
This exercise has two eyes that follow the user's mouse as it moves along the browser. This exercise demonstrates the ability to manipulate styles and positions based on live data in the browser, incorporating JavaScript, html, and css. By incoporating eyes.js and styles.css, a function will fire onmousemove. In this function the position of the client is tracked and scaled to translate the eyeballs ('ball') based on the user's x and y position in the browser, and update styles.css. 

## How to Run?
First, download all the files as a .zip file. Then extract the files onto a folder of your choice and load index.html into a browser. 
Move your mouse around the browser window and watch the two eyes follow like they would in a game.

## Roadmap of Future Impovements
An improvement that I'd like to implement as a callback to the Nintedo 64 game Super Mario 64 is to have the eyes shrink in size or increase in size if the mouse cursor goes clockwise or counterclockwise respectively. This would be similar to one of ways you kill the eyeball guy in Super Mario 64. Another fun thing to do is to make the eye or eyes similar to how it looks in Mario.
